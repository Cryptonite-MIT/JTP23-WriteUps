# Day 5

1) I first opened the VM and opened the DOS Cheat Sheet terminal.
2) I went through the different commands available and how it's used.
3) When trying to read bumaster.exe file, it said it could not be read.

4) According to the troubleshooting section in README.TXT, file signature should be 41 43.

5) I then edited the AC2023.BAK file and replaced XX with AC which is 41 43 in hexadecimal.

6) Then I read the 'BUMASTER.EXE' file again and the required flag came.
