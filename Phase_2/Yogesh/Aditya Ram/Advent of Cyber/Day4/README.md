# Day 4

1) I opened the VM and then used the link to see the login portal.
2) I then created a password list using the cewl command using the Antarticrafts homepage.
3) I then used the cewl command to create a list of usernames using the employees of Antarticrafts.

4) I then used the wfuzz command to brute force webpages.
   - -z file,usernames.txt loads the usernames list.
   -  -z file,passwords.txt uses the password list generated by CeWL.
   - --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" hides responses containing the string "Please enter the correct credentials", which is the message displayed for wrong login attempts.
   -  -u specifies the target URL.
   -  -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords.

5) I then use the obtained username-password combination to log in to the website
6) I then click on the confidential message and the flag appears.
