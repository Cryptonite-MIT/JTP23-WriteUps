I downloaded the file and ran it on my linux machine

I didn't knew what header file was so i googled it and found out it's the first line of the hex file of the bmp file
so to run the bmp file i had to edit the header file, so i googled what the header file of the bmp file should look like
and accordingly the changes in offset `0A` and `0E` i didn't understand what to do in `0A` so i put it as 0 and `0E` to 40 in hex for which is 0028

i ran the file it worked but i didn't get the password

i coldn't figure out the problem, then it clicked that the aspect ratio is a bit off
so i googled what offset are meant for the aspect ratio of the file 
i kept changing the height little by little and after a few attempts i got the flag

#### Typical Flag Transfer Protocol
Started by downloading the file, saw it was a pcapng file
I had no clue what that is so i googled what that is, read a bit about. Didn't understand anything
so I googled how to run it, it gave me a software called `Wireshark`. Downloaded it via terminal following : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-and-use-wireshark-on-ubuntu-linux/
uploaded the file

I see something called `TFTP Protocol` and reaslised it was the name of the file i just ran. I take it as a clue and google `TFTP Protocol`
it's a file transfer function which doesn't require authentication.
I export all the Networks w/tftp protocol to a folder
i get a 3 bmp files and 2 text files. I go through one of the file. It's Encryted so i run it through dcode.fr
it was encrypted in ROT13 format

a/to it should go to plans.txt

check out the photos!!??
didn't make alot of sense so i went to other files which i extracted from deb

`steghide`
i read about it. so i have to use it on terminal to extract those bmp file
which i do.

DONE!

#### Macrohard Weakedge
the best approach to finding files hidden inside other files is binwalk
if we perform binwalk "Forensics is fun.pptm" we'll see there's a bunch of .zip files. we can extract it using binwalk -e "Forensics is fun.pptm"

Now there's _Forensics is fun.pptm.extracted folder which I will navigate using 7zip.

Since there's too many things in 0.zip I decided I might as well automate the search process. I extracted 0.zip then navigated to it in the terminal.

i see this file at the end of the list of files
i cat it

it seems like an encryption

#### Lookey here
downloaded the file, quite straight forward tbh tried a few variations of grep

#### Enhance
downloaded the file looked up the meaning of the file
![image](https://github.com/aghogwarts/JTP23-WriteUps/assets/147993943/956dd586-5e31-4030-8ba9-b8f82c376e09)
it's vector!
i have worked with vectors before in designing (more of the reason that i should be in cryptonite)

it cat the file to get the strings format of the file i get this!!
it's kind off like an html code

````
i go through this and all i find is a bunchof x axis and y axis coordinates and the text files present there
on the ends of the code i see { 3 n h 4 n 3 d _ a a b 7 2 9 d d } looks like a flag to me!

so i try picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_aab729dd}
haha! easy

#### Wireshark doo dooo do doo...
opened the file in wireshark, skimmed through the protocol, nothing interesting
opened protocol hierarchy to check if there are any txt files
i find two of them one in html format, i see {} looks like a flag so i copy and run through a decoder i get the flag

#### advanced-potion-making
i downloaded the file, i opened it in a hex editor, i couldn't figure out the file type so i googled how to do it! i got this article
https://www.hackingarticles.in/forensic-investigation-examining-corrupted-file-extension/
acc to this the file should be png!
i correct the header the file
i thought i was done and i saved my image here, but it wouldnâ€™t open. Going back to my comparison between a random valid PNG and my corrupted file
i realized that the hex values of addresses 0x00000009 to 0x0000000B were incorrect. 
after changing them to 00 00 0D to match my valid PNG, I saved it and opened it to see a red image.
So weâ€™re not done yet. Ugh.
However, when I see red (or really any solid color), I try using stegsolve. I flipped through a bunch of options until Red plane 0, and we have our flag!

The hardest part of CTF really is reading the flag. For some reason, I thought the 1 was an l at first!

#### So meta
lmao too easy, by meta i go and look at metadata

from here i tried looking at it's metadata, hexdump and all of the stuff i couldn't find anything so i saw a write up online, it used a commnad called zsteg
and for some reason it's not working on my terminal

so i 

#### hideme
downloaded the file, did all the basic hit and trial!
thought of going with binwalk, worked surprisingly
i find files there, so i extract it, i see a file called "secret" so obviously i open it, then i find one more image

i got the flag!
#### Packet Primers
opened the file in wire shark went through a few netwoks found the flag
